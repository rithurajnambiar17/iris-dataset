# Linear Regression using Normal Equation
Using Ice-cream Revenue-Temperature data to create Linear Regression Model using Normal Equation

## Dataset
Iris Dataset - [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)

## Project Highlights
This project was developed in order to have hands-on experience on how Linear Algorithm works. Using the data a Logistic Regression model is created with Stochastic Gradient Descent that predicts whether the given Iris Plant is a virginica or not. After developing the model, simple accuracy formula was used to evaluate the model and turned out the model predicted with an accuracy of `81.57894736842105`.
